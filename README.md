# MTIL: Multitask Incremental Learning for Segmentation and Restoration


Multi-Task Incremental Learning (MTIL), provides a promising solution for **accurate tooth segmentation and restoration in child dental imaging**. MTIL combines the strengths of **transfer learning and incremental learning**, allowing us to overcome challenges such as variability in development and anatomy, data scarcity, and variations in image resolution and quality


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Tensorflew 2.xx
- A computing device with GPU

## Getting started


### Dataset & Preparation

The original [In this study, the dataset used is the UFBA-UESC Dental dataset](G. Silva, L. Oliveira, and M. Pithon, “Automatic segmenting teeth in X-ray images: Trends, a novel data set, benchmarking and future perspectives,” Expert Systems with Applications, Patterns and Images. vol. 107, pp. 15-31, 2018).

In our experiments, we used the initial preprocessed data from [this repository](https://github.com/IvisionLab/dns-panoramic-images). All images are resized into `1024x1024`.
